# Behavioral Boxes GUI and Improvement
Gonzalo - Pr√°cticas Curriculares - Universidad Rey Juan Carlos 

## Description of the project:
The project's objective is to expose students with a real-life problem of re-coding a current Python pipeline to make it user-friendly via an intuitive GUI. The second goal is to modify the output product of the pipeline to make it more manageable for Big-Data analysis.
This project aims to enhance student learning through hands-on experience in code improvement, debugging techniques, and the implementation of Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Python. The student will undertake a practical project involving the creation of a visual interface, providing users with interactive access to a Python-coded program. The project not only exposes students to real-life coding challenges but also deepens their understanding of a multiprocessing code controlling a high-throughput behavioral task.

## Goals:
- Aim 1: Become familiar with multi processes in python. 
- Aim 2: Develop GUI to control behavioral boxes.

## Methodology:
For Aim 1 and 2: Python and PyQt, tkinter and Kivy libraries to code the GUI.

## Expected results:
The expected outcomes include a thorough multiprocessing in Python, efficient development of a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to control behavioral boxes using PyQt, tkinter, or Kivy libraries, and an enhanced ability to tackle real-life coding challenges.
